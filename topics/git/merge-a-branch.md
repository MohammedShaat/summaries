# Merge A Branch

`git merge <branch name>`

To merge a branch we **checkout** to the branch which we want to **merge into**.

**Example**
```git
HP@DESKTOP-BKAJOGS MINGW64 ~/Projects/demo (main)
$ git merge update-branch
```
As we wanted to merge `update-branch` into `main`, we checkout to `main` branch
